# **Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing: 
```
python drive.py model.h5
```
The video of the project is uploaded to the youtube: https://youtu.be/tbxJqSKXMdw

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

Nvidia pipeline is used in this project with minor modifications. Final model consisted of the following layers:
 
| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 160x320x3 RGB image (normalized to [-0.5, 0.5], a Keras lambda layer)   							| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| stride: 2x2, depth: 24, subsample: 2x2, activation: Relu|
| Convolution 5x5     	| stride: 2x2, depth: 36, subsample: 2x2, activation: Relu|
| Convolution 5x5     	| stride: 2x2, depth: 48, subsample: 2x2, activation: Relu|
| Convolution 3x3     	| stride: non, depth: 64, activation: Relu|
| Convolution 3x3     	| stride: non, depth: 64, activation: Relu|										|
| Flatten		| Output = 400        									|
| Fully connected		| Output = 120        									|
| Fully connected		| Output = 84       									|
| Fully connected		| Output = 1       									|

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (the MSE value is showing below). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track. The model doesn't contain dropout layers. We use earlystopping to avoid overfitting.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 126).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

The provided images were used as training data and validation data. I was trying to collect more data by myself, such as counter-wise driving, and recovering from out of track, but it took me a while to figure out that the quality of data generated by using keyboard as control was too low to use.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the Nvidia pipeline. I thought this model might be appropriate because it contains five convolutional layers with three fully connected layers, which suggest that it is powerful enough.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. However, the most challneging part to me is the first curve after passing the bridge. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I use the left and right camera data, collect more data via data augmenting and tune the steering correction value, which greatly improves the performance.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 97-124) consisted of a convolution neural network with five convolutional layers with three fully connected layers, which is described in detailed above. 

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

As I mentioned previously, only the provided data were chosen (24108 images in total) in this project duet to the bad quality of self generated data. 

For pre-processing data, normalization and cropping are used: 
 ```
model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x / 255.0 - 0.5, input_shape=(160,320,3)))
model.add(Cropping2D(cropping=((70,25),(0,0))))
```
To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles and randomly modify the brightness of the images to generate more data and  generalize the model.

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 5. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.

In addition, generator (model.py lines 41-90) is implemented in this project, which greatly improve my laptop performance during training process.
